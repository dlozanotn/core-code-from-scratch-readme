## Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages

compiled languages are those that communicate directly with the cpu, and need to be compiled so that they can be interpreted to binary code and communicate directly with the computer.

interpreted languages are those that can be understood both by us and the computer, since they are run by commands.

compiled languages: C, C++, 

interpreted languages: PHP, Javascript

Hybrid: Java, Python


## Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?,

Both, because  a java program is first compiled into bytecode which JRE can understand. ByteCode is then interpreted by the JVM making it as interpreted language.


## Pseudocode 


 
 1.Starting point: START
  2.Input: READ, GET
  3.Output: PRINT
  4.Math: +, -, *, /
  5.Assignation: <--
  6.Initialize:  SET, INIT
  7.Add one: INCREMENT
  8.End point: END
  
  
  Solution
  
  1. START
  2. Amount of dollar <-- GET
  3. BTCprice <-- GET FROM[(https://www.coinbase.com/es-LA/converter/btc/usd)]
  4. total dollar <-- Amount of dollar * BTCprice
  5. PRINT Total dollar (result of convert bitcoin to dollar)
  6. END



## Core Challenges Mission Statement 


I'm David Lozano, I'm a web designer, I've worked with wordpress, figma, html and css, in agencies in USA; but what I want to learn is to program, to be a frontend, or full stack, and I want to work in companies where I can develop and in the future, create my own web applications.

I am a curious, resilient, self-taught and self-directed person, and I believe that you can always learn something new every day.ðŸ’»

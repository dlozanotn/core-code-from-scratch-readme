Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages

compiled languages are those that communicate directly with the cpu, and need to be compiled so that they can be interpreted to binary code and communicate directly with the computer.

interpreted languages are those that can be understood both by us and the computer, since they are run by commands.

compiled languages: C, C++, 

interpreted languages: PHP, Javascript
